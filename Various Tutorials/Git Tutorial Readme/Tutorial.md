## Before We Begin 
In my opinion, the easiest way to use GitHub is with GitBash command line

(https://git-scm.com/downloads)
		

##USEFUL GIT COMMANDS:

		//Help commands

##REPOSITORIES: The Git Folders where you store files

For every REPOSITORY:

1. You will have one corresponding LOCAL REPOSITORY on your computer

2. You will have one corresponding GITHUB REPOSITORY on your Github Account
	
##FORKING: Copying SOMEONE ELSE'S GITHUB REPOSITORY and putting it on YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY 

After you FORK, you will have a corresponding GITHUB REPOSITORY on your Github Account

However, you're still missing the matching LOCAL REPOSITORY

##CLONING: Taking all the files in a GITHUB REPOSITORY and copying them onto a LOCAL REPOSITORY

Clone into your local machine by navigating to directory of your choice and typing:
			
			git clone [Github_repository_url]
		
##PUSHING: Uploading your LOCAL FILES onto YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY

When you have both of the following:

			1. LOCAL REPOSITORY

			2. GITHUB REPOSITORY

You can start editing files in your LOCAL REPOSITORY as needed

When done, you'll UPDATE YOUR LOCAL FILES, by typing the following:
			
			git add .
			git commit -m 'Add a message, that tells what updates you did.'
	
Then PUSH the local updates onto YOUR GITHUB REPOSITORY via:
			
			git push origin master
